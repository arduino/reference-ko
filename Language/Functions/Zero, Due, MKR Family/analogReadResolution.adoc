[float]
=== 설명
analogReadResolution() 은 아두이노 두에, 제로 그리고 MKR 제품군을 위한 아날로그 API의 확장이다.

Sets the size (in bits) of the value returned by `analogRead()`. It defaults to 10 bits (returns values between 0-1023) for backward compatibility with AVR based boards.

The *Due, Zero and MKR Family* boards have 12-bit ADC capabilities that can be accessed by changing the resolution to 12. This will return values from `analogRead()` between 0 and 4095.

=== 문법
`analogReadResolution(bits)`


[float]
=== 매개변수
`bits`: determines the resolution (in bits) of the value returned by the `analogRead()` function. You can set this between 1 and 32. You can set resolutions higher than 12 but values returned by `analogRead()` will suffer approximation. See the note below for details.

void setup() {
  // open a serial connection
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the input on A0 at default resolution (10 bits)
  // and send it out the serial connection
  analogReadResolution(10);
  Serial.print("ADC 10-bit (default) : ");
  Serial.print(analogRead(A0));

  // change the resolution to 12 bits and read A0
  analogReadResolution(12);
  Serial.print(", 12-bit : ");
  Serial.print(analogRead(A0));

  // change the resolution to 16 bits and read A0
  analogReadResolution(16);
  Serial.print(", 16-bit : ");
  Serial.print(analogRead(A0));

  // change the resolution to 8 bits and read A0
  analogReadResolution(8);
  Serial.print(", 8-bit : ");
  Serial.println(analogRead(A0));

  // a little delay to not hog Serial Monitor
  delay(100);

[float]
=== 주의와 경고
If you set the `analogReadResolution()` value to a value higher than your board's capabilities, the Arduino will only report back at its highest resolution, padding the extra bits with zeros.

For example: using the Due with `analogReadResolution(16)` will give you an approximated 16-bit number with the first 12 bits containing the real ADC reading and the last 4 bits *padded with zeros*.

If you set the `analogReadResolution()` value to a value lower than your board's capabilities, the extra least significant bits read from the ADC will be *discarded*.

Using a 16 bit resolution (or any resolution *higher* than actual hardware capabilities) allows you to write sketches that automatically handle devices with a higher resolution ADC when these become available on future boards without changing a line of code.
