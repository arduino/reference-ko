`readStringUntil()` reads characters from the serial buffer into a string. The function terminates if it times out (see link:../settimeout[setTimeout()]).

This function is part of the Stream class, and is called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.
