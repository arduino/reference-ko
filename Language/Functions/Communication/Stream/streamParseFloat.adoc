=== 설명
`parseFloat()` returns the first valid floating point number from the current position. `parseFloat()` is terminated by the first character that is not a floating point number. The function terminates if it times out (see link:../streamsettimeout[Stream.setTimeout()]).

This function is part of the Stream class, and can be called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.

`lookahead`: the mode used to look ahead in the stream for a floating point number. Allowed data types: `LookaheadMode`. Allowed `lookahead` values:

* `SKIP_ALL`: all characters other than a minus sign, decimal point, or digits are ignored when scanning the stream for a floating point number. This is the default mode.
* `SKIP_NONE`: Nothing is skipped, and the stream is not touched unless the first waiting character is valid.
* `SKIP_WHITESPACE`: Only tabs, spaces, line feeds, and carriage returns are skipped.

`ignore`: used to skip the indicated char in the search. Used for example to skip thousands divider. Allowed data types: `char`
