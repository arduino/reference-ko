[float]
=== 설명
`parseFloat()` returns the first valid floating point number from the current position. Initial characters that are not digits (or the minus sign) are skipped. `parseFloat()` is terminated by the first character that is not a floating point number. The function terminates if it times out (see ../streamsettimeout[Stream.setTimeout()]).

This function is part of the Stream class, and can be called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more informatio
