=== 설명
`parseInt()` returns the first valid (long) integer number from the current position. Initial characters that are not integers (or the minus sign) are skipped.

In particular:

* Initial characters that are not digits or a minus sign, are skipped; +
* Parsing stops when no characters have been read for a configurable time-out value, or a non-digit is read; +
* If no valid digits were read when the time-out (see link:../streamsettimeout[Stream.setTimeout()]) occurs, 0 is returned;

This function is part of the Stream class, and is called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.
