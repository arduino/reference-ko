=== 설명
Read a byte from the file without advancing to the next one. That is, successive calls to `peek()` will return the same value, as will the next call to `read()`.

This function is part of the Stream class, and is called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.
