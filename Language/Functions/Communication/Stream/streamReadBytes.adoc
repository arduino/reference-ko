[float]
=== 설명
`readBytes()` read characters from a stream into a buffer. The function terminates if the determined length has been read, or it times out (see link:../streamSetTimeout[setTimeout()]).

`readBytes()` returns the number of bytes placed in the buffer. A 0 means no valid data was found.

This function is part of the Stream class, and can be called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.
