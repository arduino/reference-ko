=== 설명
`find()` reads data from the stream until the target is found. The function returns true if target is found, false if timed out (see link:../streamsettimeout[Stream.setTimeout()]).

This function is part of the Stream class, and can be called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[stream class] main page for more information.
