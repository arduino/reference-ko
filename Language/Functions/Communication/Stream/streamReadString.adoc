`readString()` reads characters from a stream into a String. The function terminates if it times out (see link:../streamsettimeout[setTimeout()]).

This function is part of the Stream class, and can be called by any class that inherits from it (Wire, Serial, etc). See the link:../../stream[Stream class] main page for more information.
