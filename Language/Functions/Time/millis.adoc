=== 예제 코드
// Describe what the example code is all about and add relevant code   ►►►►► THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY ◄◄◄◄◄
The code reads the milllisecond since the Arduino board began.

unsigned long time;

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop(){
  Serial.print("Time: ");
  time = millis();

  Serial.println(time);    //prints time since program started
  delay(1000);             // wait a second so as not to send massive amounts of data
}

[float]
=== 주의와 경고
Please note that the return value for millis() is an unsigned long, logic errors may occur if a programmer tries to do arithmetic with smaller data types such as int's. Even signed long may encounter errors as its maximum value is half that of its unsigned counterpart.
