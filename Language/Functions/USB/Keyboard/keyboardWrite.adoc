= Keyboard.write()


// OVERVIEW SECTION STARTS
[#overview]

[float]
=== 설명
Sends a keystroke to a connected computer. This is similar to pressing and releasing a key on your keyboard. You can send some ASCII characters or the additional link:../keyboardmodifiers[keyboard modifiers and special keys].

Only ASCII characters that are on the keyboard are supported. For example, ASCII 8 (backspace) would work, but ASCII 25 (Substitution) would not. When sending capital letters, Keyboard.write() sends a shift command plus the desired character, just as if typing on a keyboard. If sending a numeric type, it sends it as an ASCII character (ex. Keyboard.write(97) will send 'a').

For a complete list of ASCII characters, see http://www.asciitable.com/[ASCIITable.com].

[float]
=== 문법
`Keyboard.write(character)`


[float]
=== 매개변수
`character` : a char or int to be sent to the computer. Can be sent in any notation that's acceptable for a char. For example, all of the below are acceptable and send the same value, 65 or ASCII A:

----
Keyboard.write(65);         // sends ASCII value 65, or A
Keyboard.write('A');            // same thing as a quoted character
Keyboard.write(0x41);       // same thing in hexadecimal
Keyboard.write(0b01000001); // same thing in binary (weird choice, but it works)

=== 반환
`size_t` : number of bytes sent.

#include <Keyboard.h>

void setup() {
  // make pin 2 an input and turn on the
  // pullup resistor so it goes high unless
  // connected to ground:
  pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);
  Keyboard.begin();
}

void loop() {
  //if the button is pressed
  if(digitalRead(2)==LOW){
    //Send an ASCII 'A',
    Keyboard.write(65);
  }
}

=== Notes and Warnings
When you use the Keyboard.write() command, the Arduino takes over your keyboard! Make sure you have control before you use the command. A pushbutton to toggle the keyboard control state is effective.
