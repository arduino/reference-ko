=== 주의와 경고
The use of `goto` is discouraged in C programming, and some authors of C programming books claim that the `goto` statement is never necessary, but used judiciously, it can simplify certain programs. The reason that many programmers frown upon the use of goto is that with the unrestrained use of `goto` statements, it is easy to create a program with undefined program flow, which can never be debugged.

With that said, there are instances where a `goto` statement can come in handy, and simplify coding. One of these situations is to break out of deeply nested link:../for[for] loops, or link:../if[if] logic blocks, on a certain condition.
